# GitHub Enterprise Cloud Security
GitHub cloud is constantly changing and keeping up with that has become a bit of a challenge. New features make previous configuration obsolete and documenting that in a word doc with change tracking makes a bigger mess.

So it's time to move this to version control. While I was at it, I've documented what I consider a reasonable baseline security configuration.

## Permissions
